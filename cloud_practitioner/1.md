## EC2 Elastic Comput Cloud(EC2)

### EC2 instance families

- General purpose
- Compute optimized
- Memory optimized
- Storage optimized
- Accelerated computing ( for graphics, or floating point )

### EC2 purchase options

- On-Demand
- Savings Plans (advance claim for 1 or 3 year) - Hourly spend commitment for 1 or 3 year to specific instance family)
- Reserved Instances
  - Standard Reserved Instance (you specify fixed ec2 family, size, region)
  - Convertible Reserved Instance (you can change family, size etc but pricing changes)
- Spot Instances (are unused EC2 instances, savings upto 90%, but has interruptions)
- Dedicated Hosts (no body will share tenancy of their host)

### Scaling EC2

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

- Has regional construct(runs at dedicated region and its not per ec2 instance or group)
- Has auto scaling(wit no additional cost) and high availability(so can handle small to large traffic)
- Its a service and  has no deps on ec2 and can scale up to handle large requests and doesn't charge extra.

## SQS (Simple Queue Service)

## SNS (Simple notification Service)

- Works on pub-sub model, where message is send to a topic and all subscribers to that topic get notified.

## Serverless using AWS Lambda

## ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## AWS Fargate Serverless  platform for ECS or EKS
- instead of provisioning ec2 to build ecs or eks cluster, user can use AWS Fargate(cluster managed by AWS at scale) runs container on serverless platform

## Global Infrastructure and reliability

## AWS Regions
- A region is group of AZ
- A region consists of 3 or more AZs

Four factors into chosing regions:
- Compliance (data must live in - region)
- Proximity (closer to your customer base)
- Feature availability
- Pricing (for some features it varies from region to region)

## Availability Zone
- One or more group of data centers
- best practice to run accross 2 AZ in a region for disaster recovery
- Region service(eg ELB) are by default in HA zone (on 2 or more AZ)

## CDN 

A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

## AWS CloudFront
Is the CDN service by aws.

- AWS CloudFront uses `Edge Locations`.
- `Edge Locations` are different from `Region`.
- You can push content from inside region to collection of edge locations to boost your content


## Edge Locations

- Runs `CloudFront`, `Route 53` and more services

## AWS OutPosts

- Installs AWS mini region inside customers infrastructure(data center)

## AWS ElasticBeanstalk

- End-to-End web application management
- You directly deploy your application(your code)
- Helps to provision EC2 based envs
- We can give the desired en in configuration format and beanstalk will provision it.
- Its reusable
- Adjust capacity
- Load balancing
- Automatic scaling
- Application health monitoring

## AWS CloudFormation

- IAC (Infrastructure as Code) tool
- Lets you define your desired aws resources in json or yaml format(cloud formation template).

---

## AWC VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- Its your private network in aws
- Lets you define yourt own IP range
- Lets you define your own virtual network, where you can deploy aws resources.
- Public and Private grouping are known as `subnets`
- Public Subnet where we deploy public exposed service(like our web apps)
- Private Subnet where we deploy private services(like databases)

- `Internet Gateway`: is used to allow public traffic inside a VPC.

- `Virtual Private Gateway` - VPN service

## AWS Direct Connect

- Allows you to connect directly from your data center to your AWS VPC
- This is done using direct connect partner in your area to establish this connection
- Its an actual physical connection from your datacenter to your VPC

## Subnets
- VPC is connected to private Subnets
- Internet Gateway is used to connect with public Subnets

## Network(Network ACL): 

- Network ACL is stateless packet flitering, and allows all inbound and outbound traffic bydefault.
- If applied check packets while entering the subnet boundary(in or out)

## SecurityGroups
- Is used to restrict network at Service level within Subnet(e.g restrict what comes in n out to an ec2 instance)
- Bydefault all inbound is blocked and outbound is allowed
- Every ec2 instance has its own SecurityGroup
- SecurityGroups are stateful packet filtering

## Global networking

## Route 53

- DNS Service by AWS
- Converts domain name to its IP address
- Can redirect to different endpoins, depending on the defined route policy
  - `Latency-based routing`
  - `Geolocation DNS`
  - `Geoproximity routing`
  - `Weighted round robin`
