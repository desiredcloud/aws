## EC2 Elastic Comput Cloud(EC2)

### EC2 instance families

- General purpose
- Compute optimized
- Memory optimized
- Storage optimized
- Accelerated computing ( for graphics, or floating point )

### EC2 purchase options

- On-Demand
- Savings Plans (advance claim for 1 or 3 year) - Hourly spend commitment for 1 or 3 year to specific instance family)
- Reserved Instances
  - Standard Reserved Instance (you specify fixed ec2 family, size, region)
  - Convertible Reserved Instance (you can change family, size etc but pricing changes)
- Spot Instances (are unused EC2 instances, savings upto 90%, but has interruptions)
- Dedicated Hosts (no body will share tenancy of their host)

### Scaling EC2

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

- Has regional construct(runs at dedicated region and its not per ec2 instance or group)
- Has auto scaling(wit no additional cost) and high availability(so can handle small to large traffic)
- Its a service and  has no deps on ec2 and can scale up to handle large requests and doesn't charge extra.

## SQS (Simple Queue Service)

## SNS (Simple notification Service)

- Works on pub-sub model, where message is send to a topic and all subscribers to that topic get notified.

## Serverless using AWS Lambda

## ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## AWS Fargate Serverless  platform for ECS or EKS
- instead of provisioning ec2 to build ecs or eks cluster, user can use AWS Fargate(cluster managed by AWS at scale) runs container on serverless platform

## Global Infrastructure and reliability

## AWS Regions
- A region is group of AZ

Four factors into chosing regions:
- Compliance (data must live in - region)
- Proximity (closer to your customer base)
- Feature availability
- Pricing (for some features it varies from region to region)

## Availability Zone
- One or more group of data centers
- best practice to run accross 2 AZ in a region for disaster recovery
- Region service(eg ELB) are by default in HA zone (on 2 or more AZ)
