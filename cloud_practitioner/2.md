## Instance stores 

- The local storage that comes up with ec2 instance
- Attached to underlying host, if instance is stopped or removed then you will lose your data
  - In case to stop and then start, ec2 might get created in another host and lose data



## AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) 

- You can create virtual harddrive called `EBS Volumes` that you can attach to your ec2 instance
- As its sperate from the ec2 instance, you dont lose data when you stop and start the instance
- Allows to take incremental backup (called Snapshots)
- Sizes upto 16 TiB
- HDD (Its a hard drive)
- Its an AZ level resource
- Both ec2 instance and ebs volume needs to be in same region.
- EBS volume do not automtically scale

In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

The data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file. Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on. An object’s key is its unique identifier.

- Unlimted storage
- Data is storated as an objects in buckets
- Maximum object size allowed is `5 TB`
- Version objects
- Different storage classes:
  - `S3 Standard`: 99.999 % of durability for a period of 1 year
    - Data is stored in atleast 3 facilities
  - `S3 Standard-Infrequent Access or S3 Standard-IA`
    - Good for data which are access less frequenlty 
    - But requires rapid access when needed
    - Good for backups, disaster recovery or any files that need long term storage
  - `S3 Glacier Flexible Retrival`
    - Good for audit datas, or archived data
    - has vault policy(e.g: WORM Write once read many), and you can lock data
  - `S3 One Zone-Infrequent`
  - `S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval`
  - `S3 Glacier Deep Archive`
  - `S3 Intelligent-Tiering`
  - `S3 Outposts`
- With the help of life cycle policy, you can tell to keep my data for certain days on `S3 Standard` then move it to `S3 Standard-IA` keep it for X days then move it to `S3 Glacier`


## AWS EFS(Elastic File System)

- Managed file system
- AWS manages scaling and backup or keeping redundent copy of file system
- Multiple instances reading and writing simultaneously
- Its a Linux file system
- Regional resource
- Can Automtically scale (can scale upto Petabytes)
